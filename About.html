<p>I live at a place called Yombo Vituka found in Temeke district, in Dar es Salaam, Am a Tanzania citizen born at Kigoma region, both of my parents are from Kigoma and am proud of being Tanzanian.</p>

<p>As someone who love and care about others, i like and enjoy being around the people i love, my family and friends, they make me be myself around them, but i got to admit am not good at making friends easily because am always not comfortable and free to the people who am not used to talk with, but still i like to have peace with everyone.</p>
