Apart from wishing to have a better happy life which am sure everyone does, they say every person have this *WISH* that the day it will come true can be one of the memorable day in their life, **i have that wish** too. I have always wish one day i could play piano, *i love it* to bad i haven't given it a time really. I dont know when but i know one day my wish will come true.
