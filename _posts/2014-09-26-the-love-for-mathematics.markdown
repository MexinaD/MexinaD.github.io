In the process of learning, when i was still in primary school i found myself loving this subject alot, when to most of students they see as the nightmare and wish it was not neccessary for them to study in primary and secondary eduation, to me Mathematics was and still is the best subject of all and i got to say i have always enjoyed it.

My friends used to ask me how and what i do to be good at mathematics, there is no an secret of someone doing better in this subject more than doing more practise and try to love it. Someone once said "You have to love what you are doing  in order to do it better"
